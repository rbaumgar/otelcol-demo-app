*By Robert Baumgartner, Red Hat Austria, Janurary 2022 (OpenShift 4.9)*
*By Robert Baumgartner, Red Hat Austria, Janurary 2023 (OpenShift 4.11, OpenShift distributed tracing 2.7)*

In this blog I will guide you on

- How to use OpenTelemetry with a Quarkus application.

- How to display your OpenTeleemtry information on Jaeger UI.

In this blog I will use distributed tracing to instrument my services to gather insights into my service architecture. I am using distributed tracing for monitoring, network profiling, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern, cloud-native, microservices-based applications.

Using distributed tracing lets you perform the following functions:

- Monitor distributed transactions
- Optimize performance and latency
- Perform root cause analysis

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing consists of two components:

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform - This component is based on the open source Jaeger project.
Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection - This component is based on the open source OpenTelemetry project.

This document is based on OpenShift 4.11. See [Distributed tracing release notes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/distr_tracing/distributed-tracing-release-notes.html).

OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator is based on Jaeger 1.39.

OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator based on OpenTelemetry 0.63.1

## OpenTelemetry and Jaeger

**OpenTelemetry** is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

**Jaeger** is a tool to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems.

In the following diagram I will show you how the flow will be between your application, OpenTelemetry and Jaeger.

To make the demo simpler I am using the AllInOne image from Jaeger. This will install collector, query and Jaeger UI in a single pod, using in-memory storage by default.

More details can be found
- [OpenTelemetry Reference Architecture](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)
- [Jaeger Components](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.39/architecture/#components)

## Enabling Distributed Tracing

A cluster administrator has to enable the Distributed Tracing Platform operator once. 

As of OpenShift 4.11, this is be done easily by using the OperatorHub on the OpenShift console. See [Installing the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/distr_tracing/distr_tracing_install/distr-tracing-installing.html#distr-tracing-jaeger-operator-install_install-distributed-tracing).

In the current version (Jaeger 1.35+) the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator is no longer required. Jaeger has a collector port available.

In this demo we do not install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator, because we use only in-memory tracing - no persistence.

Make sure you are logged in as cluster-admin:


After a short time, you can check that the operator pod is created and running and the CRDs is created:

```shell
$ oc get pod -n openshift-distributed-tracing 
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jaeger-operator-6878757487-fzv4f   2/2     Running   0          3h10m
$ oc get crd jaegers.jaegertracing.io
NAME                       CREATED AT
jaegers.jaegertracing.io   2021-12-08T15:51:29Z
```

## Create a New Project

Create a new project (for example jaeger-demo) and give a normal user (such as developer) admin rights onto the project:

```shell
$ oc new-project jaeger-demo
Now using project "jaeger-demo" on server "https://api.yourserver:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
$ oc policy add-role-to-user admin developer -n jaeger-demo 
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/admin added: "developer"
```

## Login as the Normal User

```shell
$ oc login -u developer
Authentication required for https://api.yourserver:6443 (openshift)
Username: developer
Password: 
Login successful.

You have one project on this server: "jaeger-demo"

Using project "jaeger-demo".
```

## Create Jaeger

Create a simple Jaeger instance with the name my-jager
```shell
$ cat <<EOF |oc apply -f -
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: my-jaeger
spec: {}
EOF
jaeger.jaegertracing.io/my-jaeger created
```

When the Jaeger instance is up and running you can check the service and route.

```
$ oc get svc
NAME                           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                    AGE
my-jaeger-agent                ClusterIP   None            <none>        5775/UDP,5778/TCP,6831/UDP,6832/UDP                        3h10m
my-jaeger-collector            ClusterIP   172.30.99.244   <none>        9411/TCP,14250/TCP,14267/TCP,14268/TCP,4317/TCP,4318/TCP   3h10m
my-jaeger-collector-headless   ClusterIP   None            <none>        9411/TCP,14250/TCP,14267/TCP,14268/TCP,4317/TCP,4318/TCP   3h10m
my-jaeger-query                ClusterIP   172.30.139.99   <none>        443/TCP,16685/TCP                                          3h10m
otelcol-demo-app               ClusterIP   172.30.203.18   <none>        8080/TCP                                                   3h3m
$ oc get route my-jaeger -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
my-jaeger-jaeger-demo.apps.rbaumgar.demo.net
```

Open a new browser window and go to the route url and login with your OpenShift login (developer).

## Sample Application

### Deploy a Sample Application

All modern application development frameworks (like Quarkus) supports OpenTelemetry features, [Quarkus - USING OPENTELEMETRY](https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry).

To simplify this document, I am using an existing example. The application is based on an example at [GitHub - rbaumgar/otelcol-demo-app: Quarkus demo app to show OpenTelemetry with Jaeger](https://github.com/rbaumgar/otelcol-demo-app). 

Deploying a sample application monitor-demo-app end expose a route:

```shell
$ cat <<EOF |oc apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: otelcol-demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/name: otelcol-demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    app.openshift.io/runtime: quarkus
  name: otelcol-demo-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: otelcol-demo-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: otelcol-demo-app
        app.openshift.io/runtime: quarkus
        app.kubernetes.io/name: otelcol-demo-app
        app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT        
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/rbaumgar/otelcol-demo-app-jvm
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: otelcol-demo-app
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: otelcol-demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/name: otelcol-demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    app.openshift.io/runtime: quarkus    
  name: otelcol-demo-app
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
    name: web
  selector:
    app: otelcol-demo-app
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  labels:
    app: otelcol-demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/name: otelcol-demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    app.openshift.io/runtime: quarkus       
  name: otelcol-demo-app
spec:
  path: /
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: otelcol-demo-app
  port:
    targetPort: web
  tls:
    termination: edge    
EOF
deployment.apps/otelcol-demo-app created
service/otelcol-demo-app created
route.route.openshift.io/otelcol-demo-app exposed
```

You can add an environment variable with the name OTELCOL_SERVER if you need to specify a different url for the OpenTelemetry Collector. Default: http://my-jaeger-collector:4317 

### Test Sample Application

Check the router url with */hello* and see the hello message with the pod name. Do this multiple times.

```shell
$ export URL=https://$(oc get route otelcol-demo-app -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
$ curl $URL/hello
hello 
$ curl $URL/sayHello/demo1
hello: demo1
$ curl $URL/sayRemote/demo2
hello: demo2 from http://otelcol-demo-app-jaeger-demo.apps.rbaumgar.demo.net/
...
```

Go to Jager URL.
Reload by pressing F5.
Under Service select my-service. 
Find Traces...

![Jaeger Find)](images/jaeger02.png)

:star: The service name is specified in the application.properties (quarkus.application.name) of the demo app.

:star: The url of the collector is specified in the application.properties (quarkus.opentelemetry.tracer.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://my-jaeger-collector:4317).

Open one trace entry and expand it to get all the details.
